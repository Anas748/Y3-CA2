            <ul>
                <li>Each round, the player with the fewest monsters on the grid goes first. If tied, the first player is chosen randomly.</li>
                <li>On a player's turn, they can place a vampire, werewolf, or ghost on their edge of the grid. They cannot move this monster on the same turn.</li>
                <li>Monsters can move any number of squares horizontally or vertically, or up to two squares diagonally. They can move over their own monsters but not over other players' monsters.</li>
                <li>If two monsters end on the same square:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Vampire vs. Werewolf: Werewolf is removed.</li>
                        <li>Werewolf vs. Ghost: Ghost is removed.</li>
                        <li>Ghost vs. Vampire: Vampire is removed.</li>
                        <li>Same type: Both are removed.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>A player's turn ends when they decide or if they have no monsters left to move.</li>
                <li>A round ends once all players have had a turn.</li>
                <li>A player is eliminated after losing 10 monsters. The last player remaining wins.</li>
